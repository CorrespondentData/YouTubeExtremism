# De Correspondent YouTube Extremism project
Exploring extremism on YouTube.

## For each working group please create your own folder on the master branch where to place your scripts
- Please use a descriptive folder name e.g. left data scraping, topic modeling, etc.
- Please add a readme to the folder where you describe:
  - Your team members and contact information
  - Your approach; specifying which data you used as input, how you processed it (with link to script adn what frameworks are used), what your output data is and a link to where it is saved in the GDrive.
- You may create a branch for your subfolder to work on, so you do not have to synchornize all folders and scripts.
