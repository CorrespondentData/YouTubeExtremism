## Coding style
1. try to stick to **PEP-8** code guidelines
1. To keep the api surface as small as possible make functions and import private (using `_` prefix)

## Todo

1. After an error halfway through a given list, the code should be able to 
restart after the last successful
1. Add tests to the package
1. Add google api config to readme
1. Add documentation on domain and getting started using documentation generation
   * **implementation note** we could use [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)
1. Provide a better user experience with progress bar  
   * **implementation note**: we could use the [tqdm package](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
